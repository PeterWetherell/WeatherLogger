add your API_KEY, LAT, and LON in a .env file

run:
crontab -e

and append to the end of the file:
*/5 * * * * path/run_weather.sh >> path/weather_cron.log 2>1&

You can then start cron with:
sudo service cron start

To check if cron is currently running:
sudo service cron status

You can add the command to start cron in your .bashrc file to run on startup if you want.
