add your API_KEY, LAT, and LON in a .env file


sudo service cron status
# see the status of cron -- see if it is running or not

sudo service cron start
# start cron schedule manager

# I could make it so that this runs on startup (.bashrc) but I don't want to -- I am scetched out by the possibility that I exceed my API usage limits
# this is despite the fact that every 5 min = 288 != 1000 (free limit per day)
